"""Storage interface and its honest guarantees.

A storage engine persists four things: runs, events, state versions and
checkpoints. Everything else in CONTINUUM is derived from them.

Guarantees a conforming engine must provide
-------------------------------------------

* **Append-only events.** ``append_event`` assigns the next sequence for a run
  and links the hash chain. An event that already exists is never rewritten.
* **Atomic sequence allocation.** Two writers racing to append to the same run
  must not receive the same sequence number. One wins; the other retries or
  fails loudly. Silent overwrite is a correctness bug, not a performance
  trade-off.
* **Durability on commit.** Once ``append_event`` returns, the event survives
  process death.

Guarantees deliberately *not* claimed
-------------------------------------

* **Not exactly-once.** A crash between an external side effect and its ledger
  write leaves the ledger behind reality. That gap is what the action ledger
  (Phase 6) reconciles; storage cannot close it alone.
* **Not distributed.** The SQLite engine is single-host. Multi-writer
  coordination across machines needs PostgreSQL (Phase 3, optional) and is out
  of scope for the MVP.
* **Not encrypted at rest.** Checkpoints hold task state, never credentials.
