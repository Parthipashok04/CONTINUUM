"""SQLite storage engine.

Chosen defaults and why
-----------------------

* **WAL journal mode**: readers never block the writer, so `continuum inspect`
  can read a run while the agent is still working.
* **`synchronous=FULL`**: the whole point of this layer is surviving power
  loss. `NORMAL` can lose the last commits on a WAL crash, which would silently
  reintroduce the duplicate-work problem CONTINUUM exists to prevent. The cost
  is an fsync per append; correctness wins.
* **`foreign_keys=ON`**: events cannot reference a run that was never created.
* **`IMMEDIATE` transactions for writes**: takes the write lock up front, so a
  racing writer fails at BEGIN rather than halfway through a read-modify-write.

Sequence allocation is done inside the write transaction with a UNIQUE
constraint on ``(run_id, sequence)`` as the backstop. If two processes race,
one commits and the other hits the constraint and is reported as a
``ConcurrentWriteError``, never a silent overwrite.
