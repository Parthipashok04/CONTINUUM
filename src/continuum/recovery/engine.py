"""Deciding how, and whether, a run may resume.

The engine reduces three independent signals to one decision:

* validation statuses (Phase 5): is the state still true?
* the action ledger (Phase 6): did an external effect land?
* checkpoint integrity (Phases 3–4): is the record itself sound?

The decision rule
-----------------

**The most cautious applicable signal wins.** Not the first one evaluated, not
the most common: the most cautious. Each signal proposes a mode; the engine
takes the maximum on a severity ordering:

    RESUME < REPAIR_AND_RESUME < WAIT < REQUEST_HUMAN < ROLLBACK < ABORT

Order-independence matters because these signals genuinely co-occur. A run can
have a stale dataset *and* an uncertain side effect at once. If the engine
returned whichever it noticed first, the same situation would recover
differently depending on iteration order, and the unsafe answer would win
roughly half the time. Taking the maximum makes the outcome deterministic and
always errs toward caution.

What the engine does not do
---------------------------

It does not execute repairs, mutate the run, or contact anything external. It
reads state and returns a decision plus a contract. Keeping it free of side
effects means a recovery decision can be computed, logged and reviewed without
committing to it, which is what makes ``continuum validate`` safe to run
against a live database.
