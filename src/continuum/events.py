"""Append-only event log.

The event log is the source of truth for a run. Semantic state, checkpoints and
the action ledger are all *projections* of this log, which means recovery can
always be re-derived and independently audited.

Integrity model
---------------
Events form a per-run hash chain::

    e1.prev_hash = None          e1.hash = H(content(e1))
    e2.prev_hash = e1.hash       e2.hash = H(content(e2))
    ...

``EventLog.verify()`` recomputes every digest and re-walks the chain, so a
persisted log that was edited out-of-band is detectable. This is tamper
*evidence*, not tamper *proofing*: an attacker who can rewrite the whole log can
recompute the chain. Signing is out of scope for Phase 1 and documented as such.

Ordering guarantees are per run, not global: sequence numbers start at 1 and
increase by exactly 1 within a ``run_id``. No cross-run ordering is implied.
